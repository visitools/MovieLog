This is a quick vibe coded app to fulfill a quick need.

In brief, this app allows you to define a global hotkey that when you press it, it will add the current date and time, or the time since a timer was reset into an edit box on the screen.

This allows you to flag times that something of interest happened, so that you can review them later.

Use at your own risk, I accept no responsibility for what AI built under my instruction.

Enjoy : )
